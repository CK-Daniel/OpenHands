## Understanding OpenHands Capabilities

OpenHands is designed to assist with a wide variety of engineering tasks. While the technology is powerful, it's important to understand that we're still developing agents that can handle large, complicated engineering tasks independently. The key is to learn how to effectively work with the agent by understanding its strengths and limitations.

## Next Steps

Start with the [Hello World Examples](hello-world.md) to get familiar with basic interactions, then progress through the other guides as you become more comfortable working with OpenHands.
