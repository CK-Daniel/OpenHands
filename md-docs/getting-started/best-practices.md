# OpenHands Best Practices

This guide outlines key practices and tips for getting the most out of OpenHands. Following these guidelines will help you work more effectively with the AI assistant.

## Core Principles

### 1. Keep Tasks Small
- Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Focus on one specific change at a time
- Iterate gradually on complex features

### 2. Be Specific
- Provide clear, detailed requirements
- Specify technology stacks and versions
- Include any constraints or preferences
- Mention relevant file paths and component names

### 3. Provide Context
- Share relevant code snippets
- Explain the current system architecture
- Mention related components or dependencies
- Include any specific patterns or conventions to follow

### 4. Version Control
- Commit changes frequently
- Use descriptive branch names
- Write clear commit messages
- Push changes regularly

## Effective Communication

### 1. Clear Prompts
Good:
```
Please add input validation to the user registration form in ./frontend/components/RegisterForm.jsx to check for valid email formats and password strength
```

Less Effective:
```
Make the form better
```

### 2. Iterative Development
Good sequence:
1. "Create a basic user registration form"
2. "Add email validation"
3. "Add password strength requirements"
4. "Add error message display"

Less Effective:
```
Create a complete user registration system with all validations and error handling
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Development Workflow
```
1. Create/modify code
2. Review changes
3. Add tests
4. Commit and push
5. Iterate as needed
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```
1. Write test to reproduce bug
2. Fix the code
3. Verify fix
4. Add regression tests
```

### 3. Feature Addition
```
1. Plan structure
2. Implement basic version
3. Add tests
4. Enhance gradually
5. Document changes
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Documentation**
   - Request documentation for new features
   - Keep README files updated
   - Document complex logic
   - Maintain API documentation

2. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Update existing tests
   - Include edge cases
   - Verify changes thoroughly

3. **Code Quality**
   - Follow consistent coding standards
   - Request code reviews
   - Refactor when needed
   - Keep functions focused

4. **Project Organization**
   - Maintain clear file structure
   - Use meaningful names
   - Keep related code together
   - Follow project conventions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overly Complex Requests**
   - Trying to do too much at once
   - Unclear requirements
   - Missing context
   - Ambiguous goals

2. **Insufficient Testing**
   - Skipping test creation
   - Not checking edge cases
   - Ignoring existing tests
   - Missing regression tests

3. **Poor Version Control**
   - Infrequent commits
   - Unclear commit messages
   - Not using branches
   - Large, unfocused changes
