# Hello World Examples

This guide will walk you through your first interactions with OpenHands using simple "Hello World" examples in different programming languages.

## Basic Bash Script

### Creating a Simple Script
Start with a basic prompt:
```
Please write a bash script hello.sh that prints "hello world!"
```

The agent will:
1. Create the script
2. Set the correct permissions
3. Run the script to verify the output

### Adding Parameters
Enhance the script with command-line arguments:
```
Please modify hello.sh so that it accepts a name as the first argument, but defaults to "world"
```

This demonstrates how you can iteratively improve your code through prompts.

## Converting to Other Languages

OpenHands can help you work with any programming language. For example, to convert the bash script to Ruby:
```
Please convert hello.sh to a Ruby script, and run it
```

Note that when switching languages, the agent might need to:
1. Set up the appropriate environment
2. Install necessary dependencies
3. Configure any required settings

## Tips for Hello World Examples

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the most basic version of what you want to achieve
2. **Iterate Gradually**: Add features one at a time
3. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you want the code to do
4. **Test Changes**: The agent will typically run the code to verify it works
